   <p>In temperate zones, probably the most commonly grown <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornamental_plant">ornamental species<a/> is Hibiscus syriacus, the common garden hibiscus, also known in some areas as the "rose of Althea" or "rose of Sharon" (but not to be confused with the unrelated Hypericum calycinum, also called "rose of Sharon"[14]). In tropical and subtropical areas, the Chinese hibiscus (H. rosa-sinensis), with its many showy hybrids, is the most popular hibiscus.</p>
